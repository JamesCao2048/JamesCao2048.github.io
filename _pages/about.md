I am currently a PhD. student at School of Computer Science in Fudan University from September 2021, supervised by Prof. [Bihuan Chen](https://chenbihuan.github.io/) and Prof. [Xin Peng](https://cspengxin.github.io/), and a visiting PhD. student at Singapore Management University from September 2022, advised by Prof. [Xiaofei Xie](https://xiaofeixie.bitbucket.io/). I received my B.Sc. degree and M.Sc. in School of Software Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018 and 2021, supervised by Prof. [Beijun Shen](https://base.sjtu.edu.cn/~bjshen/). My current research interests focus on trustworthy AI, including quality assurance of multi-models AI systems (e.g., Apollo and Rasa), and detection of performance bugs in deep learning applications (ESEC/FSE 2022).
