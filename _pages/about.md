I am a research assistant at School of Computer Science in Fudan University. I received my B.Sc. degree and M.Sc. in School of Software Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018 and 2021, advised by Prof. [Beijun Shen](https://base.sjtu.edu.cn/~bjshen/). My research interests include empirical software engineering and program analysis, with emphasis on the detection and repair of bugs in deep learning applications. I will pursue my PhD. degree in Fudan University from September 2021, advised by Prof. [Bihuan Chen](https://chenbihuan.github.io/).
