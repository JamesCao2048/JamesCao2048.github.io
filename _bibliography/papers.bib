abstract = {IR-based fault localization approaches achieves promising results when locating faulty files by comparing a bug report with source code. Unfortunately, they become less effective to locate faulty methods. We conduct a preliminary study to explore its challenges, and identify three problems: the semantic gap problem, the representation sparseness problem, and the single revision problem. To tackle these problems, we propose MRAM, a mixed RNN and attention model, which combines bug-fixing features and method structured features to explore both implicit and explicit relevance between methods and bug reports for method level fault localization task. The core ideas of our model are: (1) constructing code revision graphs from code, commits and past bug reports, which reveal the latent relations among methods to augment short methods and as well provide all revisions of code and past fixes to train more accurate models; (2) embedding three method structured features (token sequences, API invocation sequences, and comments) jointly with RNN and soft attention to represent source methods and obtain their implicit relevance with bug reports; and (3) integrating multirevision bug-fixing features, which provide the explicit relevance between bug reports and methods, to improve the performance. We have implemented MRAM and conducted a controlled experiment on five open-source projects. Comparing with stateof-the-art approaches, our MRAM improves MRR values by 3.8- 5.1% (3.7-5.4%) when the dataset contains (does not contain) localized bug reports. Our statistics test shows that our improvements are significant},

  abstract = {Given a bug report of a project, the task of locating the faults of the bug report is called fault localization. To help programmers in the fault localization process, many approaches have been proposed, and have achieved promising results to locate faulty files. How- ever, it is still challenging to locate faulty methods, because many methods are short and do not have sufficient details to determine whether they are faulty. In this paper, we present BugPecker, a novel approach to locate faulty methods based on its deep learn- ing on revision graphs. Its key idea includes (1) building revision graphs and capturing the details of past fixes as much as possible, and (2) discovering relations inside our revision graphs to expand the details for methods and calculating various features to assist our ranking. We have implemented BugPecker, and evaluated it on three open source projects. The early results show that BugPecker achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 0.263 and mean re- ciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.291, which improve the prior approaches significantly. For example, BugPecker improves the MAP values of all three projects by five times, compared with two recent ap- proaches such as DNNLoc-m and BLIA 1.5.},

  abstract = {Coding convention plays an important role in guaranteeing software quality. However, coding conventions are usually informally presented and inconvenient for programmers to use. In this paper, we present CocoQa, a system that answers programmer's questions about coding conventions. CocoQa answers questions by querying a knowledge graph for coding conventions. It employs 1) a subgraph matching algorithm that parses the question into a SPARQL query, and 2) a machine comprehension algorithm that uses an end-to-end neural network to detect answers from searched paragraphs. We have implemented CocoQa, and evaluated it on a coding convention QA dataset. The results show that CocoQa can answer questions about coding conventions precisely. In particular, CocoQa can achieve a precision of 82.92% and a recall of 91.10%. Repository: https://github.com/14dtj/CocoQa/ Video: https://youtu.be/VQaXi1WydAU.},
