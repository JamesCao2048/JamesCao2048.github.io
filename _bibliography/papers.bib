  abstract = {Coding convention plays an important role in guaranteeing software quality. However, coding conventions are usually informally presented and inconvenient for programmers to use. In this paper, we present CocoQa, a system that answers programmer's questions about coding conventions. CocoQa answers questions by querying a knowledge graph for coding conventions. It employs 1) a subgraph matching algorithm that parses the question into a SPARQL query, and 2) a machine comprehension algorithm that uses an end-to-end neural network to detect answers from searched paragraphs. We have implemented CocoQa, and evaluated it on a coding convention QA dataset. The results show that CocoQa can answer questions about coding conventions precisely. In particular, CocoQa can achieve a precision of 82.92% and a recall of 91.10%. Repository: https://github.com/14dtj/CocoQa/ Video: https://youtu.be/VQaXi1WydAU.},
